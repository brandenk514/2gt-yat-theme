<h2>THE YOUTUBE CHANNEL</h2>
<p>
    We take very seriously the trust our viewers put in that our content is honest and truthful. Our commitment is to our
    viewers and community first; we will always attempt to have a non-biased viewpoint on all videos we produce. Every video
    is completely written by 2GuysTek, and we maintain full editorial control. No company can pay for a preferential review.
    We choose to produce videos based on newsworthiness, personal interest, or based on our use of those products. As part
    of the video creation process, we may communicate with manufacturers of the products & software covered on our channel
    and ask them to explain behaviors or comment on product deficiencies so they can share their side of the story. Our
    policy is that no vendor, sponsor, or individual is given a video preview before publication. Much of the hardware we
    review on our YouTube channel is purchased by 2GuysTek either for review or as part of a project we are working on. Any
    hardware or software provided by the manufacturer for us to review is disclosed as such in the video. Videos containing
    sponsored content are explicitly labeled in the video’s description and verbally within the video itself. It will always
    be clear what is being sponsored and the business relationship between the sponsor and 2GuysTek. We are a US-based
    company and comply with the laws set forth by the FTC:

<h2>Google AdSense Advertisements</h2>
<p>
    Google’s AdSense platform selects the advertisements placed on our YouTube videos, and we have no input or affiliation
    with the ads or the companies that produce them.
</p>

<h2>Amazon Affiliate Links</h2>
<p>
    We participate in the Amazon Associates program, which allows us to make a commission on product links we add to the
    description and comments of our videos. We only provide affiliate links to Amazon for products we’ve purchased or used
    within the video the links are included with.
</p>

<h2>eBay Affiliate Links</h2>
<p>
    We participate in the eBay affiliates program, which allows us to make a commission on product links we add to the
    description and comments of our videos. We only provide affiliate links to eBay for products we’ve purchased or used
    within the video the links are included with.
