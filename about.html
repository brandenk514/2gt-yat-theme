    Rich is a consummate nerd. He loves all things computers, servers, networking, and technology. 
    When he’s not busy being a Dad, YouTuber, Podcaster, and engineer, you can find him playing a 
    little CoD with his son and friends. Rich’s background is in infrastructure engineering and design, 
    which is a fancy way to say he keeps the packets flowing and the servers online. He fell in love 
    with infrastructure during the early years of virtualization, and his homelab has not only been a 
    source of education and learning but his playground to experiment with new technology and ideas.

<p> 
    Jon’s passion for video editing and YouTube originates all the way back to his younger days living in Wyoming
    and Montana, getting lost in the mountains with his DSLR, capturing nature’s raw beauty. Jon brings that
    passion for imagery into the videos and broll we shoot here on the channel, making sure our videos not only
    have great informational and educational value, but also look stunning. Jon’s love for technology also
    harkens back to his youth with his early years on Apple Macs. These days, Jon professionally works that
    #MSPLife which always keeps him on his toes and keeps his hands on a wide variety of technology.

    Branden is a technology enthusiast and an engineer at heart. He is passionate about all things open source,
    whether it runs on bare metal, virtual machines (VMs), or containers. When he’s not engrossed in his gaming
    PC, he enjoys spending time outdoors camping or hiking in the beautiful Pacific Northwest.
