With Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware, many homelab enthusiasts and small to medium businesses are seeking alternatives to VMware ESXi. Today, we delve into Proxmox VE, comparing it to our once-beloved VMware. If you missed our previous video on XCP-ng, check it out here.

## The Proxmox Origin Story

Proxmox was founded in 2005 by Linux developers Dietmar and Martin Maurer. Their company, Proxmox Server Solutions GmbH, has evolved into three main products: Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE), Proxmox Backup Server, and Proxmox Mail Gateway. Proxmox VE, first released in 2008, aims to provide an easy-to-use, scalable virtualization platform managing both virtual machines and containers in a single system.

### Growth and Community Support

Over the years, Proxmox VE has introduced features such as live migration, high availability, and software-defined storage and networking. A robust community supports its development, and Proxmox Server Solutions GmbH offers enterprise support subscriptions, providing professional support and exclusive repository updates.

## Proxmox VE vs. VMware ESXi: Key Comparisons

### Architecture

- **VMware ESXi:** A lightweight, type-1 hypervisor running from RAM with a closed-source kernel.
- **Proxmox VE:** Based on Debian Linux, it continues to use disk storage for various operational needs post-boot.

### Performance

Both hypervisors offer nearly equivalent performance. However, ESXi’s limits for RAM and hosts per cluster are well-defined, whereas PVE does not specify such limits.

### Usability

- **VMware ESXi:** Features a basic HTML5 GUI for host and VM management, with extended functionality requiring vCenter.
- **Proxmox VE:** Offers a built-in management interface that includes clustering, live migrations, and backup functionality without additional software.

### Features

- **VMware ESXi/vCenter:** Requires additional licensing for advanced features like distributed resource scheduling, high availability, fault tolerance, and vMotion.
- **Proxmox VE:** Provides clustering, live workload migrations, high availability, and workload balancing out of the box for free.

### Scalability

- **VMware ESXi:** Known for managing thousands of VMs, scaling clusters with vCenter.
- **Proxmox VE:** Supports clustering and can manage large collections of hosts and VMs, though less commonly used in very large environments.

### Support

- **VMware:** Offers extensive professional support, training, certifications, and a well-maintained public knowledge base.
- **Proxmox VE:** Relies on community support but also offers professional support services at different levels through Proxmox Server Solutions GmbH.

### Cost

- **VMware ESXi:** Recently eliminated its free hypervisor, making it less accessible.
- **Proxmox VE:** Free and open-source, with professional support available for a fee. Premium support is currently priced at €1020 per socket, per year.

## Real-World Examples and Interface Comparisons

Both ESXi and Proxmox VE feature built-in web management GUIs. Let’s compare their consoles and management interfaces:

### Console Interfaces

- **ESXi Console:** Provides basic host information and minimal management functionality, expecting most tasks to be managed via the web GUI.
- **Proxmox VE Console:** Sparse, with most management done via the web GUI, lacking a text-based menu for easier troubleshooting.

### Management GUIs

- **VMware ESXi:** The web GUI offers a dashboard for host state, usage, and configuration, with detailed tabs for VMs, storage, and networking.
- **Proxmox VE:** The GUI is more complex, reminiscent of vCenter, with extensive features for host and VM management, clustering, storage, and network configuration.

### Creating Virtual Machines

Creating VMs in Proxmox is straightforward, with a wizard guiding you through the process. Unlike VMware, Proxmox supports various hardware emulation options and has native TPM support for VMs.

## Pros and Cons of Proxmox VE

### Pros:

- Comprehensive feature set without additional costs.
- Built-in clustering, live migration, and high availability.
- Native VM backup functionality.
- Supports both VMs and LXC containers.

### Cons:

- Busy and complex UI with steep learning curve.
- Constant reminders about the lack of a subscription.
- No built-in menu interface for console management.
- Complicated upgrade process.
- Lack of an easy migration path from VMware ESXi.

## Conclusion

Proxmox VE presents a viable alternative to VMware ESXi, offering a feature-rich, cost-effective solution for homelab enthusiasts and businesses alike. While there are areas for improvement, its robust capabilities make it worth considering for your virtualization needs.
